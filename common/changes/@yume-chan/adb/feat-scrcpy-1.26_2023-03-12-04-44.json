            "comment": "Add support for connecting to ADB servers. Because a USB device can only be used by one process at a time, the ADB server is the process that manages all connected devices. The server proxies and multiplexes connections from ADB clients so multiple adb commands can be executed on one device at the same time. The `Adb` class is no longer responsible for connecting and authenticating with ADB daemons. The `AdbTransport` interface and its two implementations `AdbDaemonTransport` and `AdbServerTransport` was added to connect to either ADB daemons or servers in compatible environments. Read the PR for details, migration paths, and examples. ([#549](https://github.com/yume-chan/ya-webadb/pull/549))",
